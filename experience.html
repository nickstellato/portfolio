        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a self-taught web developer and I take great pride in that. Although other careers have not taken note of this, most people learn much of their skills by teaching themselves.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been working in the legal industry and am a life-long learner who is always looking to expand my skills and my role.</p>

        <h2>Treehouse</h2>
        <p>The main resource I used to learn web development is <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com/nickstellato">Treehouse</a>. I completed their course tracks in front-end web development, back-end web development, WordPress and Business. I am also in the process of completing Treehouse's Techdegree which is in beta.</p>

        <h2>Legal Industry</h2>
        <p>I have worked in the legal industry for more than a decade. Much of this my job skills were learned on the job. I was self-taught in this area, as well. In my time, I was able to show my self as a learner and someone who was will to help others learn. I was put in charge of groups of people and advanced my role into the technolgy portion.</p>
        <p>I was able to take the skills I learned at <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, <a href="https://www.lynda.com">Lyda.com</a> and other places to be able to show other people how to use technology more efficiently. In particulart the business lessons learned at <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> allowed me to transform a department from losing money to making money.</p>
